title: "IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis "
excerpt: "This was a project for my applied machine learning class. I also made some edits to take it a step further. The data used is a Kaggle dataset of 50k reviews with, half positive, half negative. The goal of the project is to predict the review of a sentiment (postive or negative) using text classification as well as deep learning models.'>"
