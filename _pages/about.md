I’m a data scientist interested in how data can be used to explain the world around us. My work often combines analysis and visualization, from exploring patterns in education and climate data to building models that uncover real-world insights. I like finding clarity in messy datasets and turning that into something people can actually understand and use.

At Columbia, I’m continuing to grow my skills in data science while working on projects that connect technical work with meaningful questions. Outside of research and coursework, I enjoy creating visual stories with data and exploring how design and storytelling can make complex ideas more intuitive.
